# Sys Admin Tool Installer 🚀

Hey there! 👋 This is a simple Bash script that helps you quickly install some essential sysadmin tools. If you're new to Linux or just want to save time, this script has got your back! 😎

## How It Works 💡

When you run the script, you'll see a cool ASCII logo (because why not? 😆) and a menu where you can choose what to install. Just type the number of the tool you want, and it will install it for you. Easy peasy! 🍋

## Tools You Can Install 🛠️

Here's the list of tools you can install with this script:

1️⃣ htop – for monitoring system resources.
2️⃣ nmap – for network scanning.
3️⃣ fail2ban – for blocking suspicious login attempts.
4️⃣ docker – for containerizing applications.
5️⃣ git – for version control (because everyone needs git!).
6️⃣ ufw – for setting up a firewall.
7️⃣ vim – because real programmers use Vim... or at least try. 😅
8️⃣ apache2 – for running a web server.
9️⃣ mysql – for databases (so you can store stuff!).
🔟 Install All – If you're feeling brave, install everything at once!

## How to Use 🚀

1️⃣ First, make sure you have **sudo** access (because you'll be installing stuff).
2️⃣ Download or copy the script into a file (e.g., `installer.sh`).
3️⃣ Give it execution permissions:
```bash
chmod +x installer.sh
```
4️⃣ Run the script:
```bash
./installer.sh
```
5️⃣ Pick the number of the tool you want to install and let the magic happen! 🎩✨

## Notes 📝
- If your system uses **apt**, **yum**, or **dnf**, the script will figure it out for you.
- If you see errors, check if your package manager is working properly.
- If something breaks... well, that’s part of learning Linux! 😆

## Have Fun! 🎉

Hope this helps you set up your tools quickly! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to tweak the script or send a PR. 🚀

Happy coding! 👨‍💻👩‍💻
